Title: "The Impact of UN Peacekeeping Operations on Long-Term Regional Stability and Development"
Research Question:
How do the duration, scope, and resources of UN peacekeeping operations correlate with long-term regional stability and development indicators in post-conflict areas?
This research would provide valuable insights for policymakers, helping to optimize the allocation of resources and improve the long-term effectiveness of UN peacekeeping operations. It would also contribute to the academic understanding of post-conflict reconstruction and international intervention strategies.
